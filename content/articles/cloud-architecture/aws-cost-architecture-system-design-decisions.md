## The Architecture-Cost Connection

Most engineers think about cost as an operational concern — something the finance team worries about after the system is built. This is backwards.

The decisions that drive the largest cloud costs are made during system design: how services communicate, where data lives, how often it moves, and what gets cached. By the time the bill arrives, the architecture is already set.

## The Most Expensive Architectural Mistakes

**1. Cross-AZ data transfer in hot paths**

AWS charges for data transfer between Availability Zones. A microservice architecture where services in different AZs call each other on every request can generate significant data transfer costs that are invisible during design.

Mitigation: Co-locate services that communicate frequently. Use AZ-aware load balancing.

**2. NAT Gateway for internal traffic**

Traffic from private subnets to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SQS) routes through NAT Gateway by default — at $0.045/GB. For high-throughput systems, this is a significant cost.

Mitigation: Use VPC endpoints for AWS services accessed from private subnets.

**3. Synchronous fan-out to downstream services**

A single API request that triggers synchronous calls to five downstream services multiplies your compute and data transfer costs by five. Under load, this compounds.

Mitigation: Async event-driven patterns where latency allows. Cache aggressively at the aggregation layer.

**4. Storing everything in RDS when DynamoDB fits**

RDS costs are dominated by instance size, not usage. A multi-AZ RDS instance runs 24/7 regardless of load. For access patterns that fit DynamoDB's model, the cost difference at scale is an order of magnitude.

## Cost as an Architectural Fitness Function

Add cost to your architectural fitness functions:

```yaml
# cost-fitness.yml
thresholds:
  monthly_compute: $2000
  monthly_data_transfer: $500
  monthly_storage: $300
alerts:
  - metric: aws.billing.estimated_charges
    threshold: 80%
    action: notify_architect
```

When cost is a first-class architectural concern, it gets the same rigour as latency and availability.
