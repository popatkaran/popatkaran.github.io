## The Problem With "Good" Initial Design

A system designed well for today's requirements will be wrong for tomorrow's. That is not a failure of the architect — it is the nature of software. The question is not whether your architecture will need to change, but whether it is capable of changing without catastrophic cost.

Evolutionary architecture is the discipline of building that capability in from the start.

## Fitness Functions

The core tool of evolutionary architecture is the fitness function: an objective, automated measure of whether the system still meets a specific architectural characteristic.

```go
// Example: latency fitness function in a CI pipeline
func TestP99LatencyUnder50ms(t *testing.T) {
    result := loadtest.Run(loadtest.Config{
        Target:      "https://api.staging.example.com/checkout",
        Concurrency: 100,
        Duration:    30 * time.Second,
    })
    assert.Less(t, result.P99, 50*time.Millisecond)
}
```

Fitness functions make architectural constraints executable. They fail the build when the system drifts from its intended characteristics — before that drift reaches production.

## Coupling Is the Enemy

The single biggest predictor of how evolvable a system is: the degree of coupling between its components. Not just runtime coupling (synchronous calls), but:

- **Temporal coupling** — services that must be deployed together
- **Data coupling** — shared database schemas
- **Behavioural coupling** — services that must agree on business logic

Each form of coupling reduces the surface area of safe change. Evolutionary architecture is largely the practice of identifying and reducing coupling before it calcifies.

## Decision Reversibility

Not all architectural decisions are equal. The most important classification is reversibility:

| Decision | Reversibility | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Database engine | Very hard | PostgreSQL → Cassandra |
| API contract | Hard | REST → GraphQL |
| Message format | Medium | JSON → Protobuf |
| Service boundary | Medium | Monolith → microservice |
| Deployment strategy | Easy | Rolling → blue/green |

Spend the most time on irreversible decisions. Document them as ADRs. For reversible decisions, prefer the option that keeps more options open.

## Practical Starting Points

1. Write fitness functions for your top three architectural concerns today
2. Map your coupling surface — identify every shared database and synchronous dependency
3. Start an ADR log — even retroactively for decisions already made
4. Prefer strangler fig over big-bang rewrites when evolving existing systems
