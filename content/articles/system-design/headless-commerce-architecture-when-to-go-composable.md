## The Composable Commerce Promise

Composable commerce — assembling a commerce platform from best-of-breed components connected via APIs — promises flexibility, vendor independence, and the ability to evolve each capability independently.

The promise is real. So is the cost.

## The Decision Framework

Before recommending headless architecture to any client, I ask four questions:

**1. Do you have multiple frontends?**
If you have a web storefront, a mobile app, a kiosk, and a B2B portal — headless pays for itself. If you have one web storefront, a monolith is almost certainly cheaper to operate.

**2. Do your frontend and backend teams deploy independently?**
Headless architecture only delivers velocity if the teams consuming the APIs can ship without coordinating with the teams producing them. If they always deploy together, you have a distributed monolith.

**3. Do you need to replace individual capabilities without rebuilding the whole platform?**
This is the core value proposition of composable. If your checkout logic is stable but your PIM is a mess, composable lets you replace the PIM without touching checkout.

**4. Do you have the engineering maturity to operate distributed systems?**
Headless commerce means API contracts, versioning, distributed tracing, and eventual consistency. Teams that struggle with a monolith will struggle more with a distributed system.

## The Hidden Costs

The costs that are consistently underestimated:

- **API contract management** — every integration point is a contract that must be versioned and maintained
- **Distributed debugging** — a checkout failure that spans five services is harder to diagnose than one that spans one
- **Organisational alignment** — composable architecture requires organisational composability. Teams that are tightly coupled will recreate that coupling in their APIs

## When the Monolith Wins

For a single-market, single-channel retailer with a stable product catalogue and a team of fewer than 20 engineers: a well-structured monolith will outperform a composable architecture on every metric that matters — time to market, operational cost, and developer experience.

The goal is not to be headless. The goal is to build the right system for the problem.
